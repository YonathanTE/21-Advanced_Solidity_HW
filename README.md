## Explanations

### Process to purchase PUP token
In order to purchase the token, the funds would need to be sent to the crowdsale contract, allowing the funds to be deposited in exchange for the token. The screenshot below depicts two different contracts that be utilized to add the token into the contract, token_address, and purchase the token, token_sale_address.

### To add the PUP token onto MyCrypto
In order to add the token onto the MyCrypto application, the token_address, from the screenshot above, needs to be entered into the wallet, like the screenshot provided below. After doing this, the rest of the information for the token should automatically appear.

### Tested transaction to fund the PUP toke sale address
Sending ETH on either the Ropsten or Kovan testnet in a successful manner should result in similar pages as the two depicted here. One from the MyCrypto application and another from Etherscan (a block explorer for Ethereum).
